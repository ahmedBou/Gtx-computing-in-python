# Define the function 'add'


def add(num1, num2):
    sum_ = num1 + num2
    return sum_

# Calls the function


add(3, 7)
print("Done!")
# When the code above is run, what line is executed after line 11?

# Line 2 or 3 are both acceptable answers. When executed, line 2 creates the function, but it's also the
# line that the program jumps to when the function is called.
# When the function is called, execution actually begins with line 3.
